Nutwerk_MageTestable
====================

DESCRIPTION:

This project aims to make Magento testable with PHPUnit by providing patches
to Mage.php class. Those patches will allow to insert values, objects and MockObjects
into several static/singleton Mage functions.


FEATURES:

 - Mage::setStoreConfig($path, $value, $store = null)
 - Mage::setModel($modelClass, $model)
 - Mage::setResourceModel($modelClass, $model)
 - Mage::setResourceSingleton($modelClass, $model)
 - Mage::setHelper($name, $helper)

Mage::setModel() and Mage::setResourceModel are implemented as FIFO registry arrays.
All the other methods use simple registries.


INSTALLATION:
This project provides patched Mage.php files for different Magento version.
The version is appended to the filename.

Simply copy the Mage_<version>.php for your current Magento version to your test folder
and include it in your test setup.

The only thing that has to be changed is the value of the "BP" constant at the beginning
of the file to match your Magento root directory.

That's it :)
